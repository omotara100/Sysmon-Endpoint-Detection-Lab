# Mini Report — Sysmon Endpoint Detection

## Summary
This project demonstrated how endpoint telemetry enables detection of
real attacker behaviors using Sysmon and Windows event logs.

## Key Detections
- Network scanning via Nmap
- PowerShell outbound network activity
- Raw TCP connections using Netcat

## Outcome
- Endpoint visibility successfully deployed
- Attacker behavior investigated and documented
- Log data converted into Sigma detection rules

## Final Assessment
This lab shows strong understanding of endpoint telemetry,
Windows internals, and detection engineering fundamentals.
